console.log("javascript is working");

//1. A parameter is a variable declared as one of the inputs of the function, 
//an argument is the actual value the function recieves.

//2. A return will return the value specified to whatever called the function,
//and terminate the function. A console log just logs something to the console and nothing else.

//3. You can call a function where a value should go and the expression will evaluate
//with the value the function returns in that place. This can even be inside a call to another function.
